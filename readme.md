## Instruction

### Pnpm
I have used Pnpm package manager for this project. If you already have pnpm installed on your system then just type the following command inside client and sever folder separately after cloning this repo: 

```bash
  pnpm install
```

### Npm
But if you are not aware of it then simply delete the files  named pnpm-lock.yaml from client and server folder
and type the following command inside client and sever folder separately : 

```bash
  npm install
```
